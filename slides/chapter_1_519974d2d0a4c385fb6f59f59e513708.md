Hi. In the last lesson you learned about two methods for combining data in a way similar to that of Excel's VLOOKUP. Let's next look in depth at the first of these methods, the "merge" method.


---
## pandas.DataFrame.merge

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "874c3244d5"
```

`@part1`
- Joins a Pandas DataFrame with either another DataFrame


`@part2`



`@script`
The pandas.dataframe.merge method is used to join a Pandas DataFrame with another DataFrame or named Series object. The join is typically performed on columns although the method can also be used to join two objects on indexes. This method is very powerful and includes several options to fit your needs.

## pandas.DataFrame.merge

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "cffa29bd9e"
```

`@part1`
- Joins one Pandas DataFrame with another DataFrame or named Series object
- Typically used for joining on columns or indexes
- Flexible and powerful method


`@part2`

`@script`
The pandas.dataframe.merge method is used to join a Pandas DataFrame with either another DataFrame or a named Series object. The join can be performed on one or more columns even if the column is an index. This method is very powerful and includes several options.

## Generic Syntax

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "63520c5100"
```

`@part1`
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, match_type)


```
DataFrame.merge(right, how='inner', on=None,
	left_on=None, right_on=None, left_index=False, 
    right_index=False, sort=False, 
    suffixes=('_x', '_y'), 
    copy=True, indicator=False, validate=None)
```


`@script`
A generic merge statement contains several options. It looks complicated compared to VLOOKUP, but each piece is quite specific. Let's go through and relate the pieces of the method to their counterparts in Excel. You might recall that Pandas methods work on entire columns at once as if we had an identical VLOOKUP formula in each row of an Excel column.

## Generic Syntax - 'DataFrame'

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "cdc029e4cf"
```

`@part1`
**DataFrame**.merge(right, how='inner', on=None,
	left_on=None, right_on=None, left_index=False, 
    right_index=False, sort=False, 
    suffixes=('_x', '_y'), 
    copy=True, indicator=False, validate=None)

=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, **table_array**, col_index_num, match_type)

- Defines the "base" table where values will be matched.


`@script`
'DataFrame' corresponds to 'table_array' in a VLOOKUP formula. It defines the "base" table where you want to match a series of values.


---
## Generic Syntax - 'right'

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7465a2e207"
```

`@part1`
=VLOOKUP(**lookup_value**, table_array, col_index_num, match_type)

DataFrame.merge(**right**, how='inner', on=None,
	left_on=None, right_on=None, left_index=False, 
    right_index=False, sort=False, 
    suffixes=('_x', '_y'), 
    copy=True, indicator=False, validate=None)




- Defines the table with values to look up.


`@script`
'right' defines a Pandas DataFrame or named Series to be joined with 'DataFrame'. You might recall that a single statement in Pandas can operate on all values in a column and groups of columns at once. The range defined by 'right' contains one or more 'lookup_values' along with any other data in that table.


---
## Generic Syntax - 'how'

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "40c64885df"
```

`@part1`
**DataFrame**.merge(right, how='inner', on=None,
	left_on=None, right_on=None, left_index=False, 
    right_index=False, sort=False, 
    suffixes=('_x', '_y'), 
    copy=True, indicator=False, validate=None)


=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, **table_array**, col_index_num, match_type)

- Defines the "base" table where values will be matched.


`@script`
'DataFrame' corresponds to 'table_array' in a VLOOKUP formula. It defines the "base" table where you want to match a series of values.
